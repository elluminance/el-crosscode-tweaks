# For Users
## Arena Tweaks

#### HP Recovered Bonus
![](/readme-imgs/arena-hp-recov.png)

Adds an HP Recovery bonus to arena rounds to help offset the damage penalty. 

*Can be disabled in options.*

#### Arena Item Refunding
![](/readme-imgs/arena-sandwich.png)

Any item that is used during an arena round will be automatically returned upon ending a round (regardless if you win, lose, or just exit the round in general).

*Can be disabled in options.*

## Assist Mode
![](/readme-imgs/assist-mode.png)

Adds an assist mode option to adjust timing windows of both perfect guards and perfect dashes.

**Note: Timing windows can be lowered without having assist mode considered to be enabled.**

## NG+ Perks
![](/readme-imgs/ng-perfectionist.png)

**Perfectionist** will make it so that any non-perfect guards will instantly cause a Guard Break. *However*, it also increases the perfect guard window threefold, while also automatically refreshing the shield on a perfect guard (effectively giving free Riposte).

Comparable to Dash Master, but for guarding instead of dashing.

![](/readme-imgs/ng-nudist.png)

Makes it so you cannot wear any equipment. Can you beat the game *naked*?

## Item Spawner

*Note: Must be enabled in the options menu to work.*

*Where to access the menu, once enabled*

![](/readme-imgs/item-spawn-menu.png)
*The menu itself. Note that not all elements may be present depending on what mods you have installed.*

An item spawn menu, allowing you to add any item in the game to your inventory. 

Item search functionality requires [CCInventorySearch](https://github.com/conorlawton/CCInventorySearch) (or any other mod adding the text input element) to be installed.
